jOrder - JavaScript data management redefined

jOrder is a lightweight JavaScript library that supports fast search (including full-text), ordering, and modification on JSON tables.

This version allows indexed fields to have array values, so that searching for any of the values inside the array finds the row.

Latest version: 1.0.0.8-rfunk (dev)
